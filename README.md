# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

A Java-based Tic-Tac-Toe game with AI opponents of varying difficulty levels, including Random, Beatable, and Unbeatable AI using the Minimax algorithm. Players can compete against another human or different AI modes.

## üöÄ Overview 

Tic Tac Toe is a solved game, with a draw being forced if both players play optimally. If a player plays optimally, he can win or draw based on the other player's moves. Two players play the game on a 3x3 grid where each player is assigned 'X' or 'O'. The game takes turns with each player placing their mark on the grid. The player wins if he places his mark in a completely horizontal, vertical, or diagonal way. The game is a draw if the grid is full with no player winning. The game contains 138 terminal states and 255,168 possible valid states. The complete game tree at the start of the game has a depth of 9 (first depth 0).

## üèÜ Features 

-  **Play Against AI or a Human Opponent**  
-  **Multiple AI Difficulty Levels**:  
  - **Random AI**  (Picks moves randomly)  
  - **Beatable AI**  (Makes some mistakes)  
  - **Unbeatable AI**  (Uses the Minimax algorithm)  
-  **Console-based UI**  
-  **Modular and Extensible Codebase**  

## üéÆ How to Play 

1. **Run the game** and enter the name of the player
2. **Choose the Game mode** select **1** to play against AI or **2** to play against another Human player.
3. If playing against AI, choose difficulty:  
   - **1** - Random AI 
   - **2** - Beatable AI  
   - **3** - Unbeatable AI (Minimax)
4. If playing against another Human, enter his name
5. **Enter your move** by selecting a row and column (1-3).
6. The **game ends** when a player wins or the board is full (draw).
7. **To replay the game** enter **1** or enter any other key **to exit**
8. **Enjoy playing!** üéâ

## :robot: AI Implementation

This is a simple implementation of a brute-force minimax algorithm that has no extra features like:
- Alpha-beta pruning
- Depth in score
- Evaluation function
- etc...

The **Unbeatable AI** uses the **Minimax Algorithm** to find the best move by:
1. Finding all possible moves
2. Alternating between MIN and MAX opponents
3. Assigning each terminal state a value
   - +1 for a WIN
   - -1 for a LOSS
   - 0 for a TIE
4. Backtracking to choose the move with the highest score

## üìåFuture Improvements
- Add depth to the best move to choose the fastest move to win
- Add alpha-beta pruning for optimization
